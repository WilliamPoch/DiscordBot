# DiscordBot
Repository for feelsbotman <br>
Current stable version <br>
**Current bugs and issues** <br>
 - Logging resets daily in heroku due to file saving. (Must relocate chat logs to offsite host or cloud).
 - Certain commands have been disabled or are non-functioning. (steam, cache, cards, lastfm, setColor, and wf commands are still WIP and are thus non-functioning).
 - Redundant and inefficient coding. (Migration to python is inorder to help legibility and reduce code redundancy. Another solution is an OOP wrapper for Javascript).
